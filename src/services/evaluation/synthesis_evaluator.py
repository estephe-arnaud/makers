Synthesis Evaluator Module

This module provides tools for evaluating the quality of synthesized research content.
It implements a LLM-as-a-Judge approach to assess different aspects of synthesis quality:
- Relevance: How well the synthesis addresses the original query
- Faithfulness: How accurately the synthesis reflects the source context
- Coherence: (Planned future feature) How well-structured and logical the synthesis is

The evaluator uses LangChain's framework and supports multiple LLM providers.

You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing the relevance of a generated synthesis to an original user query.
Relevance measures how well the synthesis directly and appropriately addresses the query.

**Original User Query:**
{query}

**Generated Synthesis:**
{synthesis}

**Evaluation Instructions for Relevance:**
1. Carefully read the user query and generated synthesis.
2. Evaluate how well the synthesis addresses the key points of the query.
3. Ignore factual accuracy or writing quality for now, focus only on relevance to the query.
4. Provide a relevance score between 0.0 (completely irrelevant) and 1.0 (perfectly relevant).
5. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for your score.

You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing the faithfulness (factual accuracy) of a generated synthesis against provided source context.
Faithfulness measures whether claims in the synthesis are properly supported by the source context and don't contain information contradicting or hallucinated beyond this context.

{query}

**Source Context Provided to Synthesis Agent:**
{context}

**Generated Synthesis (to evaluate for faithfulness TO SOURCE CONTEXT):**
{synthesis}

**Evaluation Instructions for Faithfulness:**
1. Carefully read the source context and generated synthesis.
2. Verify each major claim in the synthesis. Is it directly supported by information in the source context?
3. Identify any information in the synthesis that contradicts the source context or appears to be additional information not present in the context.
4. Provide a faithfulness score between 0.0 (completely unfaithful, many hallucinations or contradictions) and 1.0 (perfectly faithful, all claims supported by context).
5. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for your score, citing examples if possible.

        Reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics offers several advantages. One key benefit is the ability for robots to learn complex behaviors
        in dynamic environments without explicit programming for every scenario. For instance, RL allows robots to adapt to unforeseen
        obstacles or changes in task requirements. Another benefit is the potential for discovering novel solutions that human programmers
        might not conceive. Robots can learn manipulation skills, navigation strategies, and even human-robot interaction through trial and error.

        However, applying RL to real-world robotics faces significant challenges. Sample inefficiency is a major hurdle; robots often require
        a vast number of interactions with the environment to learn a task, which can be time-consuming and costly, especially with physical hardware.
        Safety during learning is another critical concern, as a robot learning by trial and error might perform actions that could damage itself,
        its surroundings, or humans. The sim-to-real gap also poses a problem: models trained in simulation often do not transfer well to the real
        world due to discrepancies in physics modeling and sensory inputs. Finally, reward shaping can be difficult; designing effective reward
        functions that guide the robot towards the desired behavior without leading to unintended consequences is a complex art. Some papers (e.g. ArXiv:123.456) mention new methods for safe exploration.
